      <h2>History</h2>
      <div class="history-content">
        <p>Rafting Adventures was born from a deep love for the untamed beauty of rivers and the exhilarating rush of whitewater. Our story began over two decades ago, in <strong>2005</strong>, when a small group of seasoned river guides, united by their passion, decided to share the magic of river exploration with others. They believed that the unparalleled thrill of navigating rapids and the serene beauty of untouched riverbanks should be an experience accessible to everyone.</p>
        <img src="images/hero.jpg" alt="History placeholder image" class="history-img">
        <p>What started as a humble operation, offering weekend excursions on local rivers and hidden gems across the region, quickly grew by word-of-mouth. Our commitment wasn't just to adventure, but to safety, sustainability, and creating genuinely unforgettable moments. We meticulously scouted rivers, trained our guides to the highest standards, and invested in top-tier equipment to ensure every trip was both thrilling and secure. Over the years, Rafting Adventures has had the privilege of guiding thousands of individuals, families, and groups through some of the most breathtaking whitewater in the country.</p>
